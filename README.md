# Bootstrap Starter
This project is from the YouTube video: https://youtu.be/QP3fG31CdMg

## What is it?
Just a simple project that has TypeScript, Sass, and Bootstrap hooked up for you.

## How to use it
Be sure to run `npm install`

For development use the npm script:
```
npm run dev
```
This will watch for Sass and TypeScript changes and restart the server.


Happy Coding!
